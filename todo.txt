- More fine-grained control over the autocompile triggering: should be possible to set the mode for each trigger
  separately, so that a service can be in "triggered" mode for file-changes, but "automatic" for dependency recompiles
- Switch profile during runtime
- Reset-action for services
- Retry starts up to n times? configurable option
- Toggleable output types for output window
- Fullscreen output
- Search in output
- Support services that are run and then detach, i.e. have a separate stop command?
- Parameterizable wait times for kill-signals for processes
- categorize services
- git checkout window
- load .env file from directory?
- different color A if file watching fails?
- Override env in profile?
- very long lines in output, if wrapping, will spill to the left side on the next line?
- dump output to file -feature. Allow choosing which services, categories and how many lines or all.
- Colorize/parse output based on regex rules to denote log levels?
- log files for server and client. Remove all unwraps, log error instead.
- Move client state to server?
- dynamic views (not enum boxes) views that may wrap their own state. Views must have an ID?
- hideable charts at the top for CPU, memory, network usage?
